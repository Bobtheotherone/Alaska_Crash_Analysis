Alaska-Crash-Analysis
This is the github repository for the Alaska Car Crash Analysis Capstone project completed by Radames Mercado and Peyton Ratzer in the Fall 2025 University of Alaska Computer Science capstone course.
Navigating the github repo is as follows:
- The Data Cleaning implementation is in the Data Cleaning directory
- The Machine Learning Model implementations are in their respective directories underneath the Machine Learning Models directory
- The Root directory contains some utils for the Machine Learning Models including leakage_column and severity_mapping utils
- The GPT Generator directory is a ChatGPT generated synthetic data creator which was not used in the final version of the product, only for testing purposes

The project was aided by the use of various AI models including ChatGPT, Gemini, and various others. The AI use in the coding and project was done according to guidelines outlined by UAA faculty including our capstone syllabus.
